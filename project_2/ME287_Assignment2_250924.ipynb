    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction:\n",
    "Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a matrix factorization technique has an important role in machine learning based applications. Everytime we visit Amazon, Youtube, Netflix, or any other e-commerce websites; we see some recommendations for the products, videos or movies etc. based on our previous views or with highest ratings by users. One of the appplications of SVD is to build these recommender systems with dimensionality reduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore SVD's application to a movie recommendation system.\\\n",
    "Through a small learning exercise, let's see why SVD works for movie rating prediction in recommender systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question:\n",
    "The following table is a movie-rating matrix. Each row of a matrix represents a user(U1, U2, ....,U6) and each column represents a movie name(M1, M2, ...., M5). The entries of the matrix are ratings given by user for the corresponding movie. (Rating:0 is a worst movie. Rating:5 is the best movie)\n",
