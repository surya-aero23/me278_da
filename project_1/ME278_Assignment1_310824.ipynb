    "The power method is used to find the largest eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. As we studied in class, the input needed is only a matrix-vector product. In that sense, it is a matrix-free method as far as we know the matrix-vector multiplication terms. This method becomes very useful in dealing with matrices of very large size.\n",

    "   \n",
    "   In this manner, every row is a backward cyclic permutation of its previous row.Â **However**, there is an additional condition: the row's starting element, which is backwards permuted in the current row, gets doubled in the next row.\n",
